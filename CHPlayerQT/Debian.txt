When install debian package it will install all the Dependency. 
If it not install you have to manuel use ldd on the program to se all Dependency. 
ldd CHPlayerQT.

Try it out and tell me if you know any thing about the error on some system when start.
CHPlayerQT: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt6Multimedia.so.o: no version information avaialble (required by CHPlayerQT). 

Install of the program on Debian creates a Icon under VideoAudio. 
From this you can start the program. 
Start the program manuel is just type CHPlayerQT on command line.

Best Regards.
Puste.
