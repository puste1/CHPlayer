CHPLayer QT on Linux. (Created in Linux Mint)
First you have to install QT Creator community Edition.
And after that you have to Clone all the files from this src folder.
Then You have to load QCHPlayer.pro. (This is the Project File) 
And when all are read into QT Creator then you are ready to compile the program.
Compile has to be for release not debug. 
Before Program is compiled. You have to ensure that you install all prerequisite.
VLC Player should be installed on the system. And MP3 Audio Codec. Ex.  
sudo apt install libmad0 libmad0-dev
sudo apt install libmpg123-dev
sudo apt install vlc (You can also install VLC via Flatpack) 

Then You should be ready to run the program in Linux.
When I found a way to create a package, then I will share this.
